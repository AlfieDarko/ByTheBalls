Table Tennis Tournament WebApp - Sign up and set up tournaments between your friends

## Intro

I set out to create a Table Tennis Tournament WebApp that can manage the lively tournament games that happen at Makers. I wanted to use this a project to encorporate all the front-end skills I have been learning recently, from CSS Flexbox layouts to React and Redux.

## Spec

Users can sign up and create a number of tournaments that is linked to their account. They can either use anonymous profiles as players in the tournament or invite their friends to sign up. Upon creating a tournament the user selects an even number of players that can compete and then the webapp formulates a tournament table that can keep track of game scores and the winner & losers.
