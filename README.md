Table Tennis Tournament WebApp - Sign up and set up tournaments between your friends

## Intro

I set out to create a Table Tennis Tournament WebApp that can manage the lively tournament games that happen at Makers. I wanted to use this a project to encorporate all the front-end skills I have been learning recently, from CSS Flexbox layouts to React and Redux.

## Spec

Users can sign up and create a number of tournaments that is linked to their account. They can either use anonymous profiles as players in the tournament or invite their friends to sign up. Upon creating a tournament the user selects an even number of players that can compete and then the webapp formulates a tournament table that can keep track of game scores and the winner & losers.

## User Stories

MVP User Stories:

## Approach
 I wanted to use this as a practice project to implement something with fairly complicated logic so that I could implement redux in a way that would make sense. Using redux for a much more simpler project would not have allowed me to see the full benefit state management. <br>
 This project also allowed me to mess around with CSS and creating more component based layouts. <br><br>

 Some of the things I would change if approaching this type of project again is that I would opt to create the layout from scratch. This is a layout I used from codepen but creating my own from scratch would have allowed me to brush up on my HTML and CSS abilities especially flexbox and CSS grid which is something I am actively trying to improve at.<br><br>
